To debug the app you can use `yarn dev-inspect`

When you run that command you will see a message saying the the debugger is listening on port 9229. Then you can connect your debugger. 

On chrome you can open `chrome://inspect` in a new tab. 
On VSCode you can run the `Debug: Attach to Node Process` command.
