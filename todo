- adjust prettier and format on save (prettier)
- make current user data immutable/frozen
   - test assignment instead of comparisson in getMembershipsInGroup and see if there is an error
- add new queries, think about both areas of the app:
    - users
    - lessons
- create some kind of enum for permissions to avoid type errors
- add tests to the auth system
    - should we use seeds as fixtures?
- add logs to the server
    - turn on and off
    - redirect queries
- create logout mutation
    - persist token in db?
    - only allow authorized users
        - login (only allowed for unauthenticated users)
        - logout (allowed for most users)
    - think about only running authorized queries in prod
        - security
        - avoid recursive queries to compromise the server
- frontend
- postgress db
    - migrate password field types to varchars(since PG native are richer)
    - create enum for roles field
    - postgress tool to see the db
- take a look on prisma's data guide
- deploy
    - how to access running instances, query the DB, interact with the app? 
    - add restrictions on migrations, seeds, etc...
