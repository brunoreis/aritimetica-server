- improve login mutation tests
    - add types to mutation return in login.test.ts
    - test prisma client for tests with a db change (create a create mutation?)
    - ensure we are not requiring dotenv in the code anymore (only in the package.json inclusion)
    - write docs about .test.env
    - write docs about the test
    

- create some kind of enum for permissions to avoid type errors
- adjust prettier and format on save (prettier)
- improve resolver types (root)

- add tests to one query (to have an example of a query and another of a mutation)

- add version num to the logs (git commit) 
- add a request_id to the frontent and propagate 

- add tests to the auth system
    - should we use seeds as fixtures?

- create logout mutation
    - persist token in db?
    - only allow authorized users
        - login (only allowed for unauthenticated users)
        - logout (allowed for most users)
    - think about only running authorized queries in prod
        - security
        - avoid recursive queries to compromise the server
- frontend
- postgress db
    - migrate password field types to varchars(since PG native are richer)
    - create enum for roles field
    - postgress tool to see the db
- take a look on prisma's data guide
- deploy
    - how to access running instances, query the DB, interact with the app? 
    - add restrictions on migrations, seeds, etc...

- telemetry: prisma / jaeger / ...
    - telemetry: see if we already can bind prisma queries to requests (request_id/user_id): https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/7596
    - add a final query count (num of queries during the request) to the logs 

- logs - add extra graphql info

Login - optimize to set the currentAuthUser with the same log in user (low prio)
