- add logs to the server
    - add a user_id to the child logger
        - add a log visualizer/filter
            - text concurrent requests (same number of queries?)
            - inspect prisma code to see if we can pass something extra in the event.
    - add a request_id to the child logger
    - log each step of the authorizer
    - apollo server logs
    - test what happen and log errors that happens inside resolvers. Ex: types/User.ts:77
    - add a final query count (num of queries during the request) to the logs 

    - debug/check num of open connections and if there is a pg restriction on that
    - redirect logs to specific channels (heroku/datadog?)

- learn how to debug js
- create some kind of enum for permissions to avoid type errors

- adjust prettier and format on save (prettier)
- improve resolver types (root)
