        - security
        - avoid recursive queries to compromise the server
- frontend
- postgress db
    - migrate password field types to varchars(since PG native are richer)
    - create enum for roles field
    - postgress tool to see the db
- take a look on prisma's data guide
- deploy
    - how to access running instances, query the DB, interact with the app? 
    - add restrictions on migrations, seeds, etc...

- telemetry: prisma / jaeger / ...
    - telemetry: see if we already can bind prisma queries to requests (request_id/user_id): https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/7596
    - add a final query count (num of queries during the request) to the logs 

- logs - add extra graphql info

Login - optimize to set the currentAuthUser with the same log in user (low prio)
